Water Quality Monitoring System

Problem Statement :

Water covers 70% of our planet, and it is easy to think that it will always be plentiful. However, freshwater—the stuff we drink, bathe in, irrigate our farm fields with—is incredibly rare. Only 3% of the world’s water is fresh water, and two-thirds of that is tucked away in frozen glaciers or otherwise unavailable for our use.

 

As a result, some 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water, and a total of 2.7 billion find water scarce for at least one month of the year. Inadequate sanitation is also a problem for 2.4 billion people—they are exposed to diseases, such as cholera and typhoid fever, and other water-borne illnesses. Two million people, mostly children, die each year from diarrheal diseases alone.

 

Many of the water systems that keep ecosystems thriving and feed a growing human population have become stressed. Rivers, lakes and aquifers are drying up or becoming too polluted to use. More than half the world’s wetlands have disappeared. Agriculture consumes more water than any other source and wastes much of that through inefficiencies. Climate change is altering patterns of weather and water around the world, causing shortages and droughts in some areas and floods in others.

 

At the current consumption rate, this situation will only get worse. By 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages. And ecosystems around the world will suffer even more.

Solution : 

Water Sustainability development goal is to “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”.  
The targets cover all aspects of both the water cycle and sanitation systems, and their achievement is designed to contribute to progress across a range of other SDGs, most notably on health, economics and the environment. 

 



The aim of this project is the prediction of water quality components. This project contains sensors that can sense turbidity, ph, temperature, dissolved oxygen. These sensors send the real time data and a graph is plotted for the obtained values. When the graph crosses a certain margin where contamination cannot be tolerated further, it shows an alert that the water is more contaminated and this water should not be sent for household chores. We can take the required action based on values received from the sensors . There are certain procedures to achieve this. One such procedure is connecting the sensors to the arduino UNO and uploading it to IBM cloud for analysis.
